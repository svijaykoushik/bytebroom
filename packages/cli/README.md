## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **Installation**

Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can install the ByteBroom CLI globally using npm:

```bash
# Install the ByteBroom CLI globally
npm install -g bytebroom
````

This command makes the `bytebroom` command available in your terminal.

### **Basic Usage**

Navigate to your terminal and use the `bytebroom` command followed by the path to the directory you want to scan:

```bash
# Scan a folder for duplicates (e.g., cluttered photo libraries)
npx bytebroom /path/to/your/folder
```

For a quicker scan focusing on larger files, use the `--fast` option:

```bash
# Fast mode (quick scan for large files)
npx bytebroom ~/Pictures --fast
```

To delete the identified duplicates (with confirmation prompts), use the `--clean` option:

```bash
# Delete duplicates (with confirmation prompts)
npx bytebroom ~/Downloads --clean
```

### **Advanced Options**

The ByteBroom CLI offers several options to customize your duplicate file management:

```bash
# Exclude specific file types (e.g., RAW photos, logs)
npx bytebroom /path/to/folder --exclude "*.CR2, *.log"
```

You can also create backups of the duplicates before deleting them using the `--backup` option:

```bash
# Backup duplicates before deleting (safety first!)
npx bytebroom /path/to/folder --clean --backup ~/backups
```
