## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **Installation**

Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can install the ByteBroom CLI globally using npm:

### **Basic Usage**

Navigate to your terminal and use the `bytebroom` command followed by the path to the directory you want to scan:

```bash
# Scan a folder for duplicates (e.g., cluttered photo libraries)
bytebroom /path/to/your/folder
```

For a quicker scan focusing on larger files, use the `--fast` option:

```bash
# Fast mode (quick scan for large files)
bytebroom ~/Pictures --fast
```

### **Advanced Options**

The ByteBroom CLI offers several options to customize your duplicate file management:

```bash
# Exclude specific file types (e.g., RAW photos, logs)
bytebroom /path/to/folder --exclude "*.CR2, *.log"
```

```bash
# Filter results to specific file types (e.g., only images)
bytebroom /path/to/folder --filter "jpg,png,txt"
